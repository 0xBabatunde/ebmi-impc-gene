# IMPC Gene-Phenotype Heatmap

This project is a web application that visualizes gene-phenotype associations in a heatmap using data from the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC). Users can select a list of genes and filter the data by top-level phenotype terms, and the heatmap will display the top percentage of genes with the highest count of phenotype associations. The application is built with NextJS and TypeScript, and uses the D3.js library for data visualization.

## Conceptual and Technical Decision Making

When approaching this problem, I decided to use ReactJS and TypeScript because they are popular and powerful tools for building web applications, and they provide a lot of useful features for developing scalable and maintainable code. I also chose to use D3.js for data visualization because it is a well-established and flexible library that can handle complex and interactive visualizations.

To implement the heatmap, I decided to use the novo-heatmap library because it provides a simple and customizable interface for rendering heatmaps in ReactJS.

## Building and Running the Code

To build and run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the development server using `npm start`.
4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Time Taken

It took me approximately 8 hours to complete this project.
